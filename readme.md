# TWO BOTS ONE LIE

## Fullstack AI Game with Docker Compose

This project is a fullstack AI-powered chat application designed for local development and experimentation with large language models (LLMs). It features a modern Vite + React frontend, an Express.js backend, and integrates with Ollama to run local LLMs without relying on cloud APIs. Data persistence is handled via PostgreSQL, with schema management powered by Drizzle ORM.
